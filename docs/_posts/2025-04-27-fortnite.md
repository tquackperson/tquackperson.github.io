A _fortnight_ is two weeks.
Literally, fourteen nights.
Why nights?

It seems that Germanic people called sunset the _start_ of the day.
The Anglo-Saxon people, should they have followed suit, would have naturally counted nights.
And of course, we love counting here.

Half of a fortnight is seven nights, or a _sennight_.
_Sennite_ would be a natural name for a prequel game to _Fortnite_.

## The fortnight as a unit of time

While looking into the [etymology](https://xkcd.com/1012) of _fortnight_, I ran across the humorous "microfortnight", "millifortnight", "nanofortnight", and other units derived from metric prefixes added to "fortnight".
It appears these words exist primarily because of the [Furlong-Firkin-Fortnight (FFF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FFF_system) system of units.
How FFFunny!
Now don't get me wrong, I'm all in favor of questioning the merits of well-established status quo, including the SI system.
But!
I have an objection!

As far as I'm concerned, the fortnight doesn't have a consistent duration.
The entire reason the word _fortnight_ exists is that a bunch of people used to measure their days from when the sun sets.
Sunset time changes each day, so the exact amount of time from Sunset 0 to Sunset 14 is not fixed.
And, for that matter, are we even 100% certain the fortnight is [counted exclusively, and not inclusively](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting#Inclusive_counting)?

So, even if we assume the time observer stays in the same place, a fortnight's precise duration depends on the time of year!
In fact, if we live at a latitude where the sun doesn't rise at all for part of winter, a fortnight could be much longer than two weeks.
It could be over six months long if we live at one of the poles.

But there's a certain whimsy in having a system of units that changes based on where and _when_ you are.
It's like an extreme version of how your _mass_ stays the same, but your _weight_ can ever-so-slightly vary throughout the planet, based on your local gravity.
If I feel like it soon, maybe I'll build an SI-to-FFF calculator that takes into account the changing sunset times.

Until that does exist, maybe stick with your current system of measurements.
