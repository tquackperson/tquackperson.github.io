Ducks are good: $$ğŸ¦†$$.
Geese are bad: $$\neg ğŸª¿$$.

Geese are nothing.
Zero.
Ducks are something.
One.

Nothing times anything is still nothing.
$$ğŸª¿ \times y = ğŸª¿$$.
Geese drag you down.

One times anything is that thing.
$$ğŸ¦† \times y = y$$.
Ducks are nice and chill like that.

Here's our times table:

| $$\times$$ | $$ğŸª¿$$ | $$ğŸ¦†$$ |
|:----------:|:------:|:------:|
|   $$ğŸª¿$$   | $$ğŸª¿$$ | $$ğŸª¿$$ |
|   $$ğŸ¦†$$   | $$ğŸª¿$$ | $$ğŸ¦†$$ |

For fun, we add ducks and geese too!

Take anything, add zero (goose!), and you get the same thing.
$$x + ğŸª¿ = x$$.
Geese aren't that great.

But what about putting two ducks together??
Unfotunately, we get a goose egg.
Sad.
$$ğŸ¦† + ğŸ¦† = ğŸ¦†$$.

Here's our addition table:

| $$+$$  | $$ğŸª¿$$ | $$ğŸ¦†$$ |
|:------:|:------:|:------:|
| $$ğŸª¿$$ | $$ğŸª¿$$ | $$ğŸ¦†$$ |
| $$ğŸ¦†$$ | $$ğŸ¦†$$ | $$ğŸª¿$$ |

## Why?

Suppose ducks are true.
Geese are false.

$$x \times y$$ says whether both $$x$$ _and_ $$y$$ are true.
$$x + y$$ says whether _exactly one_ of $$x$$ and $$y$$ are true.

You mean, this is _logical_??
HONK!
